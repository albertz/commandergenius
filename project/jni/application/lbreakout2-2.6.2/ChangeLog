remaining bugs)

	 reflection

occur when new options are initiated

2.0-pre1:
-ball is drawn correctly when moving up/left
-modified paddle reflection conditions
-normed the perpendicular vector of brick edges
-balls are properly reset when destroying a brick
with the 'metal' bonus (and no reflection occurs)
-highscore chart saved directly after game over
-new advanced option: ball below/above bonuses
-fullscreen/windowed switch by 'f' now allowed everywhere
-added a spec file for RPMs (thanks to Dennis Bjorklund)
-added some very important range checks for reflection

2.0beta:
-smooth paddle resize
-bonus shadows drawed correctly (doesn't overlap other bonuses)
-modified brick reflection and hopefully fixed 
the 'through walls like a ghost' bug
-fixed the wrong color key of frame (thanks to Andre Trindade)
-restart is allowed even with no life left if you got enough points to
buy a continue
-added a missing include in config.c and fixed some newline warnings

2.0alpha-2:
-bit depth is adjusted to the settings of your desktop (instead of 16bit
hardcoded)
-correct color key for paddle and balls at bit depth > 16

2.0alpha:
-major code redesign and clean-ups
    -C++ -> C
    -structured source
-resolution changed from 512x288 to 640x480 (no black frame in fullscreen)
-up to 4 players (alternate)
-fading improved
-score counting improved
-optional constant frame rate (to prevent LBreakout from
consuming 100% CPU time)
-event handling improved:
    -paddle does not slow down if framerate drops
    -moving paddle and firing weapon at the same time now works for Linux
    (problems with Mac and BeOS - therefore added an --enable-warp
    option - see the README for more)
    -usage of 'invert mouse' and 'motion modifier' improved
-shadow added
-graphics improved
-ball velocity specified by difficulty instead of level
-added a grab option to keep mouse in window (thanks to Mark Rowe)
-time of a bonus (if any limit) is added to current time (instead of
setting it)
-new bonuses:
    'End Of The Rainbow': while this is active each brick without
    a bonus will release 1000 points
    'Joker': destroys all malus' and collects all bonus on screen
    doubling time limit and score (if any)
-added and changed sounds
-new menu
-fixed a bug in shot handling (wrong bricks removed)
-the global highscore path is no longer hard-coded in the configure
script (option: --with-highscore-path)
-improved the paddle:
    -works perfect! (balls won't go through the paddle)
    -real convex behaviour
-improved the brick reflection (though edges need a better reflection
behaviour)
-in the menu ESCAPE takes back to the previous menu instead of
leaving the game
-integrated feature-packed level editor
-PNG is used for graphics (to beat the 1MB limit of the SDL competition)
-new documentation
