"Basically you play the game as in single player mode but their are some "
"special things you might find useful to know.##PINGPONG:#The point here is "
"to play it fast and to use all of your balls. Use the right and left mouse "
"button to fire the balls while moving the paddle. Your opponent will have "
"trouble to reflect all balls if you do it right. If you are not sure wether "
"you got balls left click anyway. Keep the button pressed for a while! The "
"fire rate is restricted to one ball every 500 milliseconds.##NORMAL:#Your "
"goal here is too gain more score than your opponent to win a round. "
"Basically you do this by clearing bricks and collecting extras but there are "
"some other ways as well:#1) To loose a ball means to loose 10% score. After "
"five seconds penalty a new ball is created and you can continue playing.#2) "
"Hitting your opponents paddle with the plasma weapon will give you 1000 "
"points while stealing him/her the same amount.#3) Bonus/penalty magnet will "
"attract _all_ bonuses/penalties even those released by your opponent.##Note: "
"If you pause the game by pressing 'p' a chat will pop up and you can talk to "
