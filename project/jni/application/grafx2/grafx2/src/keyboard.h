/// Functions to convert bewteen the SDL key formats and the keycode we use
/// in grafx2.
/// The keycode we're using is generalized to handle mouse and joystick shortcuts
/// as well. The format can be broken down as:
/// - 0x0000 + a number between 0 and SDLK_LAST (about 324) : the SDL "sym" key number.
/// - 0x0000 + SDLK_LAST+1: Mouse middle button.
/// - 0x0000 + SDLK_LAST+2: Mouse wheel up.
/// - 0x0000 + SDLK_LAST+3: Mouse wheel down.
/// - 0x0000 + SDLK_LAST+4+B : Joystick button number "B", starting at B=0.
/// - 0x0800 + a number between 0 and 0x7FF: The scancode key number, for keys which have no "sym", such as keys from multimedia keyboards, and "fn" and "Thinkpad" key for a laptop.
/// Add 0x1000 for the Shift modifier MOD_SHIFT
/// Add 0x2000 for the Control modifier ::MOD_CONTROL
/// Add 0x4000 for the Alt modifier ::MOD_ALT
/// Add 0x8000 for the "Meta" modifier ::MOD_META (On MacOS X it's the CMD key)
