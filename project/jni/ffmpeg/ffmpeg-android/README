Toolchain setup
---------------

Download the Android NDK Revision 5b from
http://developer.android.com/sdk/ndk/index.html

Extract it into a folder (e.g. your home directory, the example is
for the mac os x version):

tar -jxvf android-ndk-r5b-darwin-x86.tar.bz2
mv android-ndk-r5b android-ndk


Extracting the source
---------------------

The original upstream source (and the patches, if any) can be extracted
by running ./extract.sh.

Building
--------

To build, first set the environment variable NDK to point to the
directory where the NDK is installed:

export NDK=~/android-ndk

Then just call ./build.sh.

To clean up the newly built files (removed unused files, remove libraries
with version numbers in the name), call ./clean-build.sh.
