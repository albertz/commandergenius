Known bugs
==========

1. Merge all config screens into single big config screen, make option to rerun config.

2. Fix on-screen keyboard, add more keys and more options, make possible for application to control it.

3. Add full QWERTY on-screen keyboard.

4. Add trackball sensitivity and accelerometer sensitivity config.

5. Export phone vibrator to SDL - interface is available in SDL 1.3

6. HDMI output (HTC Evo and Samsung Epic support that):
HDMI output will be tricky - I've read the doc here: 
https://docs.google.com/View?id=dhtsnvs6_57d2hpqtgr#4_1_HDMI_output_support_338048
It says that in order to output something to HDMI you need to have a VideoView class visible on screen: 
http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/VideoView.html .
This class does not have any method like "showMyOwnCustomImage()", 
it just plays the video from the given path, so obvious solution is to create 
special FIFO file or open a socket, point the VideoView to play this FIFO or socket, 
and then write raw uncompressed video frames to that FIFO with some small header so that 
VideoView will recognize it as a proper video format.
UQM gives 5 FPS without such hacks, if I'll implement that FPS will drop to 1-2 
(maybe not that bad, I have to actually try that), because you'll have to do huge memcpy(), 
plus VideoView will contain some buffer to ensure the playback is smooth, 
so the data on your TV will lag halfsecond behind the data on the device screen.

7. Make app data to come inside .apk file in assets instead of downloading it from net.

8. OpenTyrian: 
  1. Navigating game menus downwards with trackball skips events, that does not happen
     when navigting upwards.
  2. The detail level can be set to WILD by pressing "w" key in gameplay escape menu, expose that through interface.
  3. Add ENGAGE mode to menu.

9. Ur-Quan Masters: 
  1. Add Russian, Deutsch and Slovak translations: http://wiki.uqm.stack.nl/Translations
  2. Add accelerated GFX (even at the cost of GFX bugs, if Melee will work smoothly).
  3. Add proper netplay with masterserver and server list instead of "Enter host IP here" dialog.

10. Add an option to keep aspect ratio of screen

11. Add an option for overlay buttons transparency.
